   <h1>About my future</h1>
   <p class="page3-future">I always feel insecure and stressed when I start thinking about and planning my future because I am not as good as others who are the same age. The movie <em><a href="https://www.firstshowing.net/2016/miles-teller-anna-kendrick-in-official-trailer-for-comedy-get-a-job/" target="_blank"> <span class="movie-name">“Get a Job”</span></a></em>, a script by Anna Kendrick impressed me so much. She said, “I'm 22 years old and I have no idea what I'm going to do with the rest of my life.” </p>

  <h1>Future career</h1>
  <p>In the future, I want to work in the media and communication industry, like in a public relations agency, a magazine company or a radio station, etc. I like to communicate with others, I want to work in an industry that could let me build relationships and connections with people.</p>

  <p>In Hong Kong, I studied <a href="https://www.cie.hkbu.edu.hk/main/en/programmes/associate_degree_programme/com/jorm" target="_blank"> Journalism in College of International Education </a> in Hong Kong.I learnt how to broadcast and I found it fun and interesting, so I am quite interested in the broadcast industry, I want to work in a television station, either speaking in front of the TV or working as a behind-scenes crew.

<h1>Slasher</h1>
<p>Sometimes I think about being a slasher because I want to try multiple careers at the same time, for example, I want to be a content creator like a YouTuber, meanwhile I am a broadcasting journalist. Although it is challenging to do different jobs, it is still interesting. </p>
